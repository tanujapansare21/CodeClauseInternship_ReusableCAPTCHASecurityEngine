CAPTCHA can be deployed to protect systems vulnerable to e-mail spam, such as the webmail services of Gmail,
Hotmail, and Yahoo!. CAPTCHA have also found active use in stopping automated posting to blogs or forums, whether as
a result of commercial promotion, or harassment and vandalism. CAPTCHA also serve an important function in rate
limiting, as automated usage of a service might be desirable until such usage is done in excess, and to the detriment of
human users. In such a case, a CAPTCHA can enforce automated usage policies as set by the administrator when certain
usage metrics exceed a given threshold. An example of a system in which vulnerabilities exist, which could easily be
prevented using CAPTCHA.

A CAPTCHA system is a means of automatically generating new challenges which:

1. Current computers are unable to accurately solve.
   
2. Most humans can solve.
 
3. Does not rely on the type of CAPTCHA being new to the attacker. Although a checkbox "check here if you are not a
bot" might serve to distinguish between humans and computers, it is not a CAPTCHA because it relies on the fact that an
attacker has not spent effort to break that specific form.
